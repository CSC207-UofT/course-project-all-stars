**For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:**

**(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or**

Our program currently can’t offer the user much option when it comes to accessibility since it uses a CLI instead of a GUI.

In the future, we can create a GUI that would adhere to the Universal Design Principles. Since our program is created according to the Layers of Clean Architecture, a GUI can be easily added by swapping out the existing CLI within the Interface Adapters Layer without having to rewrite any codes contained within the inner layers of the program such as the Use Cases Layer and Entities Layer. 

Dark Mode Feature can be created to make it easier on the eyes for the user when navigating through the different menus of the program. A clear and simple “options” menu can be created to let the user change the appearance of the program. This feature would fall under Principle 2: Flexibility in Use, Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use, and Principle 4: Perceptible Information, and Principle 5: Tolerance for Error.

Custom GUI Size Feature can be added to help users who may have poor eyesight to have a better time reading information off the screen. A clear and simple “options” menu can be created to let the user change the size of different GUI components such as font size and button size. This feature would fall under Principle 2: Flexibility in Use, Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use, Principle 4: Perceptible Information, and Principle 5: Tolerance for Error.

**(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.**

Our hospital management program is intended only for a select subgroup of people. For now, the target audience for our program are hospital administrators. 

**Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.**

The hospital management program is marketed specifically toward doctors and hospital administrators. 

**Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.**

Since our program is a hospital management program, we expect only a small subgroup of people such as doctors and hospital administrators to use it. People working outside of a hospital setting are highly unlikely to use it.
